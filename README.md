# BOOKS-BAZAAR
Books Bazaar is a platform built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for buying and selling books. Users can find new and second-hand textbooks, novels, and stationery items. The site offers affordable options for students by allowing them to sell used books. The front end is complete, with the back end in progress.
